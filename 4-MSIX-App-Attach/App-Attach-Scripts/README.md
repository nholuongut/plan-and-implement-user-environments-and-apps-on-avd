# App Attach Scripts

This directory contains scripts for manually staging and registering MSIX packages for App Attach. They used to be a requirement for setting up MSIX App Attach with AVD, but they are no longer needed. Their functionality has been integrated into the portal and AVD service (thank goodness!). I'm leaving them here in case you are curious, and because they are shown in the course.
